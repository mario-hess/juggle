<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Juggle is a simplistic audio player built with Electron and React. Our goal was to create a crossplatform and easy-to-use audio player for the desktop that supports a variety of audio file formats.

One of the standout features of Juggle is its ease of use. The interface is straightforward and intuitive, allowing users to quickly navigate through their playlists. In addition to its user-friendly interface, Juggle also supports a range of audio file formats, including MP3, WAV, FLAC, and more. This makes it a versatile choice for anyone who wants to listen to music from their local library.

### Built With

Juggle was built with Electron and React. Electron is a popular open-source framework that enables developers to build cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. React, on the other hand, is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, allowing developers to create interactive UI components that can be easily reused across different parts of the application. Together, Electron and React provide a powerful combination for building desktop applications that are convenient to build and user-friendly.
